		<h3>about</h3>
		<p>&emsp;<em>Shrimp Soup</em> is a cooking game where the player helps customers with their problems by making them
			magical soups. Each customer has likes and dislikes, which are randomized at the start of each play through.
			By learning what ingredients certain customers prefer, the player can make the best soups possible!</p>
		<p>&emsp;<em>Shrimp Soup</em>, as it stands now, is more of a demo than finished game. The finished Shrimp Soup will have
			a "final boss" at the end of a week of working at the soup shop. Skills the player has acquired during the
			week (including player preferences and ingredient effects) will culminate. We also hope to add money to the
			game, so the player can be paid extra for good soups, and use that money to buy ingredients or maybe even
			decor. We also want to add a guide with hints that will help the player figure out what effects each
			ingredient has. <b><a class="play" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BZ9V4helU2dTuUlvlmIzEhJTj5R-QIzl/view?usp=sharing">PLAY HERE</a></b></p>
